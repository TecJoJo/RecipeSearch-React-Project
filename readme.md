This is project forked from John Smilga's cocktial-search project https://github.com/john-smilga/react-projects-15-cocktails<br>
I used different api from themealdb.com. I also changed the tiny bug of the original projects which when navigating back from single item page back to the searching page ,sortting result not refresh.
In this mini-web-applicationg **React and React-router-dom6** was used along with many of other basic React hooks<br>
Data used in this project are fetched from themealdb free API.<br>
Find your favorite meal!<br>
